# 📉 Tech Layoffs vs Stock Market Impact

This project is an end-to-end data pipeline and interactive dashboard analyzing how major tech company's layoffs affect its respective stock prices over 5-day and 1-year horizons.

This project answers a simple but controversial question:

> Are layoffs actually good for shareholders?

Using Layoffs.fyi data and Yahoo Finance stock prices, the system automatically builds a clean dataset and visualizes how markets respond to workforce reductions.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

This project:
- Ingests real-world layoff data
- Matches companies to stock tickers
- Measures stock reactions after each layoff
- Builds an interactive Streamlit analytics dashboard
- Runs regression and correlation analysis

The result is a research-grade dataset and a live analytical dashboard that explores the relationship between layoffs and stock performance.

## 🧹 Step 1 — Clean & Filter Layoff Data

- Loads raw Layoffs.fyi data  
- Keeps Post-IPO companies only  
- Converts company names to stock tickers  
- Removes invalid tickers  

Output:
```text
data/raw/clean_layoff_data.csv
```

## 📈 Step 2 — Measure 5-Day Market Reaction

- Uses Yahoo Finance data to compute:
  - Dollar change
  - Percent change
- Measures price movement 5 trading days after each layoff  

Output:
```text
data/processed/layoff_vs_immediate.csv
```

---

## 📅 Step 3 — Measure 1-Year Market Reaction

- Computes stock return from the layoff date to one year later  
- Handles weekends and non-trading days automatically  

Output:
```text
data/processed/layoff_vs_immediate_updated.csv
```

## 📊 Final Dataset Columns

Each row represents one layoff event:

| Column | Meaning |
|------|-------|
| Ticker | Stock symbol |
| Date Added | Layoff date |
| # Laid Off | Employees laid off |
| % Laid Off | % of workforce |
| $ Change 5D | Price change after 5 days |
| % Change 5D | Return after 5 days |
| $ Change 1Y | Price change after 1 year |
| % Change 1Y | Return after 1 year |

- Filters by ticker, date, and layoff size
- Scatter plots with regression lines
- Correlation heatmap
- Weighted and unweighted return statistics
- Raw data table

It lets users interactively explore how layoff size relates to stock performance.
